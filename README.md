Not supposed to be useful alone. This is just the gymnasium environments. Used as submodule in a lot of other repositories.

# Custom Gymnasium Environments

This is a collection of all the custom Gymnasium environments we built for reinforcement learning experiments.

## Environments

- **[line_follower_v0/](line_follower_v0/)**: Simulates a line follower car with discrete actions (turn left/straight/turn right) and discrete sensors.
- **[line_follower_v1/](line_follower_v1/)**: Simulates a line follower car with continuous actions (left/right wheel speeds) and discrete sensors.

## Installation

To install your new environment, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

you need to install it... so that you can import it in your code.
